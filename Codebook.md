The original dataset is a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

To generate this data, experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.`

## Tidy Dataset
During data cleaning, the raw data, which was initially fragmented into multiple text files, was coalesced into a single data frame and saved as a csv file. This includes combining the training data and test data â€“ these were initially separated for research purposes, but this separation was no longer needed.

A large number of unneeded variables were then removed from the dataset, keeping only the means and standard deviations of each measurement, while removing other statistics such as median values. This reduced the size of the data frame from 563 variables to 68 variables. The number of observations, 10299, remains the same.

A second dataset was then created, which summarizes the primary dataset by providing the mean values of each variable per subject per activity. This smaller dataset contains 68 variables and 180 observations.

## Variables
The following variables are included in this dataset. All except the first two occur twice, suffixed with either mean(), indicating that it is the mean of the continuously-recorded data, or std(), indicating that it is the standard deviation. Some of the variables are also suffixed with X, Y, or Z, indicating the axis of motion that this variable relates to.

subject indicates which of the thirty subjects this data comes from, and activity indicates which of the six possible activities the subject was performing during data collection.

The other variables come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
